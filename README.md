# Extended Euclid Algorithm

This project demonstrates the implementation of the Extended Euclidean Algorithm, which is a method to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two integers as well as coefficients (multiplicative inverses) that satisfy the equation:

ax + by = gcd(a, b)


It includes a Java program that computes the multiplicative inverse of a number modulo another number, if it exists.

## Features

- **Modular Arithmetic**: Finds the multiplicative inverse of a number modulo another number.
- **Algorithm Implementation**: Uses the Extended Euclidean Algorithm to compute results.
- **Error Handling**: Handles cases where the multiplicative inverse does not exist.
